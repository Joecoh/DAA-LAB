Divide and Conquer - Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication

Strassen's algorithm is a fast method for matrix multiplication that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It was introduced by Volker Strassen in 1969 and is known for its efficiency in reducing the number of multiplications required for matrix multiplication compared to the standard algorithm.

The standard matrix multiplication algorithm has a time complexity of O(n³) for two n × n matrices. Strassen's algorithm reduces this time complexity to O(n^log₂7), which is approximately O(n².81).

The key idea behind Strassen's algorithm is to break down the matrix multiplication into a set of smaller multiplications, reducing the total number of multiplications. The algorithm involves recursively dividing each matrix into four submatrices and performing seven multiplications instead of the standard eight.

Note: This implementation uses the NumPy library for matrix operations. Make sure to install NumPy ('pip install numpy') before running the code.
