Implement recursive and non-recursive algorithms and study the order of growth from log2n
to n!.

let's start by implementing recursive and non-recursive algorithms for computing the factorial of a number. After that, we can discuss their time complexities and study the order of growth from log₂n to n!.

Let's discuss the time complexities of these algorithms

1)Recursive Algorithm:
    The recursive algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) because, in each recursive call, it performs a constant amount of work, and the recursion depth is n.

2)Non-Recursive Algorithm:
    The non-recursive algorithm also has a time complexity of O(n) because it involves a single loop that runs n times.

Let's discuss the order of growth from log₂n to n!:

1)log₂n (Logarithmic Time):
    Logarithmic time complexity (log₂n) grows very slowly. It's a very efficient order of growth. Algorithms with logarithmic time complexity are generally considered highly efficient.

2)(Linear Time):
    Linear time complexity (O(n)) is also efficient but grows linearly with the input size. It's a common and often acceptable order of growth for many algorithms.

3)n² (Quadratic Time):
    Quadratic time complexity (O(n²)) represents a slower growth rate. Algorithms with quadratic time complexity may become inefficient for large input sizes.

4)n! (Factorial Time):
    Factorial time complexity (O(n!)) represents a very fast-growing function. Algorithms with factorial time complexity become impractical for even moderately large inputs due to the rapid increase in computations.

-----------------------------------SUMMARY--------------------------------

 log₂n is very efficient, followed by linear time complexity (n), while quadratic time complexity (n²) is less efficient. Factorial time complexity (n!) is highly inefficient and should be avoided for large inputs. It's important to choose algorithms with appropriate time complexities based on the size of the input data to ensure efficiency.
