Greedy Technique – Dijkstra’s algorithm, Huffman Trees and codes

Greedy techniques involve making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. Let's discuss three well-known applications of greedy algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph, Huffman Trees for data compression, and Huffman Codes.

1.1)Dijkstra's Algorithm:
    Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It starts from a source node and greedily selects the node with the smallest known distance to the source at each step.

1.2)Huffman Trees and Codes:
    Huffman coding is a method for lossless data compression. It builds a binary tree called a Huffman tree based on the frequency of each character in the input data. Characters occurring more frequently are assigned shorter binary codes.

This how the greedy approach can be applied to solve specific problems, making locally optimal choices at each step to achieve a global optimum in the end.
