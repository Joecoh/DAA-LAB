Dynamic programming - Coin change Problem, Warshall’s and Floyd‘s algorithms,
Knapsack Problem

1.1)Dynamic Programming - Coin Change Problem:
The Coin Change Problem involves finding the number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations.

1.2)Warshall's Algorithm (All Pairs Shortest Path):
Warshall's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

1.3)Knapsack Problem:
The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a subset of items with maximum total value, given a constraint on the total weight. Here's a Python implementation for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem:

These dynamic programming solutions demonstrate the principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, which are common in many dynamic programming problems.
