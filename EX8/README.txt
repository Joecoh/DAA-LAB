Backtracking – N-Queen problem, Subset Sum Problem


Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Here are examples of backtracking algorithms applied to the N-Queen problem and the Subset Sum problem:

1.1)N-Queens Problem:
The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

1.2)Subset Sum Problem:
The Subset Sum problem involves determining whether there exists a subset of a given set with a sum equal to a given target sum.

These backtracking examples illustrate how the technique systematically explores possibilities and efficiently prunes the search space when it determines that a solution cannot be reached.
