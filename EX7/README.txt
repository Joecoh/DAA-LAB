Iterative improvement - Simplex Method

The Simplex method is a widely used iterative improvement algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Linear programming problems involve optimizing (maximizing or minimizing) a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.

The Simplex method starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves it until an optimal solution is reached. The key idea is to move from one feasible solution to another along the edges of the feasible region, improving the objective function at each step.

Here's a high-level overview of the Simplex method:

1)Initialization:
    ->Start with an initial feasible solution.
    ->If the initial solution is not feasible, perform a preliminary step to find an initial feasible solution.

2)Iteration:
    ->While there exists a variable with a negative coefficient in the objective function, the solution is not optimal.
    ->Choose a pivot column (variable with a negative coefficient) and a pivot row (determined by the minimum ratio test).
    ->Update the solution by performing pivot operations to make the pivot element equal to 1 and other elements in its column and row equal to 0.
    ->Repeat until no negative coefficients exist in the objective function.

3)Termination:
    ->The algorithm terminates when no negative coefficients are present in the objective function.
    ->The current solution is then the optimal solution.

Implementing the Simplex method involves complex matrix manipulations and calculations, and it's typically done using specialized software or libraries. However, I can provide you with a simplified example in Python using the scipy library:
