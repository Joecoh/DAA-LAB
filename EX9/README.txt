Branch and Bound - Assignment problem, Traveling Salesman Problem

Branch and Bound is a general algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems, typically combinatorial optimization problems. It works by exploring the solution space in a systematic way and keeping track of a bound on the optimal solution. Two classic problems that can be solved using Branch and Bound are the Assignment Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

1.1)Assignment Problem:
The Assignment Problem involves finding the optimal assignment of N tasks to N workers with minimum cost.


1.2)Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
The Traveling Salesman Problem involves finding the shortest possible tour that visits a set of cities and returns to the original city.

Note that the brute-force approach to solving the TSP is not efficient for a large number of cities. More advanced techniques, such as dynamic programming or heuristics like the nearest neighbor algorithm, are often used for larger instances of the TSP.
